# ifstat.sh

ifstat.sh is a shell command to report network interface bandwith, like vmstat/iostat do for other system counters.
It works by printing the current bandwith at regular intervals. It also has several options to configure it.

ifstat.sh is an [ifstat](http://freecode.com/projects/ifstat) alternative completely written in bash.
I created it in 2011 because I knew no other way to monitor current network usage in real time.
